# Censor-Face-From-Video
This project uses OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module to detect faces from a live webcam feed. Once a face is detected, it is blurred using a Gaussian blur filter instead of drawing a bounding box. The code is designed for real-time face detection and applies blurring to each detected face.
